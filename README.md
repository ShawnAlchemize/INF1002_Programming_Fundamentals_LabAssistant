### Lab exercises
Congrats for finding my git repository. 

Depending on my mood and professor's permission, I might be able to upload the lab exercises written by myself for your own reference and study. (After each week's lab exercise of course. No cheating!)

If I missed any upload, feel free to contact me about it. Or if you have any questions regarding your own code, I'm here to assist.
